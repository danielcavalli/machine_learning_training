# Machine Learning Training
A repo with some exercises in machine learning that I've made and some datasets that I found useful during it.

## Classification
Right now it is clasified in the following categories:
- Flask: Everything where I use Python as a server side language will go here;
- Neural Networks Apps: "Apps" stands for Applications in the true meaning of the word. Here I apply everything I have learned so far during the exercises into some project.
- Neural Networs Exercises: Some Exercises
- Python Exercises: During NN learning I get to see what I need to improve in Python, so everything that I build during those Pauses for learning Python will go here.

## Source
Here it goes, every site that I use to learn will end up here.

## Datasets
(that I find nice)
### [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
70,000 images(20x20) of handwriten numbers. An awesome dataset with less than 10MB.
### [GOOGLE 1T](https://cogcomp.org/page/resource_view/69)
A huge corpus with over 13,000,000 english words and over almost 1 Terabyte of data. Even though the size of the corpus is prohibitive to casual use, it is a fascinating dataset and should be here.
